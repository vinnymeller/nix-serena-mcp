# Serena MCP Flake

Nix flake for the [Serena MCP Server](https://github.com/oraios/serena).

The serena configuration file, in this Nix version (see patch), will be located at `$HOME/.config/serena/serena_config.yml`.


TODOS (busy next few days, in case you happen to see this before then):

- [ ] Add flake-parts & more systems
- [ ] Module(s)?
- [ ] Improve config file location customization & see if upstream is interested
